# Detection of Simulated Cyberattacks with SIEM System

SIEM systems are already in use as part of the Security Operations Center (SOC) within
the organizations overall security strategy. They offer comprehensive security analyses
and enable SIEM analysts to secure the network more efficiently. In the context of the
IIoT , cyber-attacks are becoming more complex and using more points of attack, which
is why a holistic view of enterprise security is crucial [VGD+21].

However, within the IIoT environment new security challenges arise due to the high
connectivity, lack of security standards and heterogeneity of the IIoT devices [TS21,
YG19]. Furthermore, the IIoT generates masses of unorganized, disparate data that
cannot be processed and analyzed without a suitable system. Since SIEM systems are
already often in use in conventional IT systems and have emerged to address the problem
of monitoring, collecting, analyzing and categorizing machine data from different sources,
SIEM represents an promising approach in order to help processing the accruing data
within the IIoT.

This leads to new research questions. Given the task of securing an IIoT network or
application, such as an industrial plant, against cyber-attacks, an interesting question is
how an enterprise can use a SIEM system in order to enhance the security of their IIoT
network by using the opportunities offered by SIEM to retrieve the holistic view of the
ongoing events and logs within their IIoT environment and detect cyber-attacks more
efficiently. Therefore, this thesis’ general goal is to transfer SIEM to the IIoT and show,
by using a simulated environment, how cyber-attacks against an IIoT network can be
detected using a SIEM system

This leads to the following research question:

“How can SIEM be transferred to the IIoT ?”

Based on a theoretical review of the concepts of IIoT, SIEM and the role of simulations
in cyber-security, basic fundamentals for this work are established. Thereby, the focus
will be particularly on the originated risks and vulnerabilities within the IIoT . Building on
this, an overview of SIEM systems in IIoT is given. Thereby challenges and requirements
are elaborated. An simulation of cyber-attacks will be used to show the usage of SIEM
systems in the IIoT environment. This brings up the following view on three relevant
sub-areas on the overall research question:

- RQ1: What is the state of research and what distinguishes the IIoT from conven-
tional IT systems from a security perspective?
- RQ2: Which challenges arise with the adoption of SIEM to IIoT?
- RQ3: How can simulations help to enhance the cyber-security?
